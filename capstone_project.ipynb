Which neighborhoods are overfilled with particular types of venues and where you can see the clear lack of them? This project is built to answer all those questions, increase the probability of the business to succeed and provide the unknown insights about the city's neighborhoods. With the project's help, fresh entrepreneurs will have the smoothest start into the unknown land of opportunities. "
